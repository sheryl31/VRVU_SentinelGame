# Virtual Reality Sentinel Game

This is a small game made for the lab exercises for the course Virtual Reality (2018) at the TU Graz. It is a teleporting simulator made for smartphones in combination with the Google Cardboard. The 3D landscape was provided by the course.

Sentinels are enemies located on high locations that rotate slowly by 360 degrees and shoot the player on sight. The goal is to get past all sentinels without being seen.
